This is a fun restaurant to go to.
The mussaman curry that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it, they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato.
Had a late night dinner on a Saturday night.
A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
Their sake martini is wonderful.
Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.
Bravissimo !!
Once they ran out of Gnochi and made it for me from scratch!
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
Found service above average, but that could be because we were 13 of us.
When I arrived at Orsay I was thrown back, in a veyr good sense.
Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
This is the Cheers of New York, whether you've ever been there or not.
It's to die for!
Cute and decorative.
I know this is the case in many nyc eateries, but here, they really cram you in to the point where it's borderline uncomfortable.
fine dining restaurant quality.
Overall a disappointing experience for that price category.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
The food was exceptional.
You will be satisfied.
Another great place to take out-of-towners!
But, hey, there is anything better with a decent vegetarian selection in Astoria.
We were less than impressed.
A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?
but still my date was bad
Would definitely go back again.
I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.
The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
Sure, the setting is nice.
Overall a worthwhile experience.
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.
It's really a takeaway place, I wouldn't sit if I could take it home.
THE MOST FUN RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO!
Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!
Some of the finest latin women you'll see in your life hang out at Jimmy's.
Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
Their whitefish salad is excellent--all whitefish with a little mayo.
And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
I had a great experience.
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
I recommend this place to everyone who asks me where to go for a good meal.
The waitresses are nice--also you can just get counter service sit.
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
Having been a long time Ess-a-Bagel fan, I was surpised to find myself return time and time again to Murray's.
Go for it!
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
I do suggest to ask to be seated upstairs if you are looking to be a little cozy.
To speak of the Park Side, words can not describe.
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
Saul is pretty good, but definitely not great.
I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.
The flavors are very fresh and pretty inobtrusive, nothing flashy.
I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
But $1 for each small piece???
Our son loves pizza and we have a certified Neapolitan pizzaria in our home city (Seattle), we liked this nearly as much - and the differences were more about personal preference than any reflection on either restaurant.
big and soft as well as good lunch food.
No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
I liked the food at this quasi-thai restaurant.
By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.
Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
Not a great place for family or general dining.
As for the bar, this is another bad idea.
Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.
The barebecued salmon is elegantly spiced and not at all dry.
Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
What generous portions!
The workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese (gets a little messy).
I was wrong.
The wine the service was very good too.
So, the menu is written in chalk above your head and it all sounds delicious.
The highly spiced chai tea was great too.
No plans to return anytime soon.
I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
Seriously, this is the best all you can eat in town- As everyone says, the Spicy Tuna hand rolls are the best- have 4 of these, and you've broken even.
There is not a single place in Chinatown where you have a nice neighborhood feeling like here.
While Sapphire is certainly not lacking in ambiance, and probably has the best decor of any Indian restaurant I have been to in New York City, the food was not what I had hoped for.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual atmosphere that whisks you away to the left bank of the river Seine.
I just do not understand what the fuss is all about.
The meat dishes were only so-so.
His wife Tanya, the hostess, completes the comforting atmosphere by being delightfully warm and gracious.
We liked it so much, that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit New York.
The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
I have been a longtime fan of Holy Basil in the East Village, and while I do believe their food has slightly slipped in quality, I have been hesitant to be disloyal.
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
For an untrendy rip-off- eat here.
And you're hungry a few hours later.
I can't wait to go back.
I HATE HATE HATE this place.
We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.
Monday nights are a bargain at the $28 prix fix - this includes a three course meal plus *three* glasses of wine paired with each course.
Wonderful!
It took them 15 minutes to put water in our glasses.
The service is descent even when this small place is packed.
This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.
Go hungry and enjoy.
I have eaten a lot of pizza here.
This place is worth an one-hour drive.
Great value for the quality ingredients.
The Thali was small, thoroughly unremarkable, and $14.95.
The sushi is also great!
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
The food is inventive but still keeps traditional indian flavoring.
All I can say is WOW!
though the service could be better (possibly due to more than one very large group in the house), it is very cordial and warm, as is the general clientele.
The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.
The lox is always fresh too.
Sure enough, exactly 30 minutes later we got the call and were seated promptly.
Service was very friendly.
So all I'm trying to say is this restaurant is by far the best thai food restaurant I've ever been to.
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.
We actually left hungry and went across the street to Wo Hop at 15 Mott street for some good chinese food.
The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.
The service does sometimes lack focus and it is not ideal if you are in a hurry but I have never been treated rudely.
The staff offers impeccable service.
The catch is that you are charged extra for ANYTHING that you leave on your plate so don't be a greedy pig!
We ended our great experience by having Gulab Jamun (dessert) recommended by the waiter.
wont come back again for sure!
i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.
The place is sleek, modern and playfull and i will return again frequently.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
After being told that our party of three would be seated in 10 minutes and watching other parties (multiples of 2 and higher) seated for 40 minutes, the three of us were squished into a small 2-person table.
And the bill was outragous.
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
Kind, attentive wait staff.
Bon appettite!!
Salads were fantastic.
The owners and employees are friendly and their pizza is fantastic.
La Rosa waltzes in, and I think they are doing it the best.
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
A great addition to Smith Street: finally, a place that's not pretentious and filled with women wearing Ugg boots.
skip dessert.
We spent $200 in this place and left hungry and very disappointed.
It is simply amazing.
I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
It was like the servers forgot that they actually worked there and instead wanted to hang out and be cool.
I liked this place the first time but doubt I will ever return.
The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
A great way to make some money is to buy a case of snapple from Costco and sell it right outside for only $2.50.
It's all about the food !!
Fast service.
Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
The staff is excellent, specjal: that girl behind the bar, european chic.
stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.
The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
ALWAYS full with tourists (especially because of it's close proximity to Rockefeller Center).
The decor is nice, but more casual than fine dining.
This restaurant is a wonderful place to go many times and it is reasonably priced.
Bravo, Blue Hill!
Conveniently located too, being right on Bedford ave.
My friends and I came across this place while walking in the village.
Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.
The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
This place is to be avoided.
Stick to dimsum, not super overpriced noodles.
The service is fine and they allow you to enjoy the view.
My sister says it reminds her of a restaurant run by high-school students who don't know what they are doing.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
At 6:30, we were the third party there.
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere.
I will definetly be going back.
No, really.
The food is good, but very expensive for the casualness of it.
The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
The hot and sour soup was unbearably hot and tasted of only pepper and nothing else.
i love the pics of andy warhol when he used to frequent the place (he painted the ballato's sign in the window).
Try sushimi cucumber roll.
I'm saving up for my next visit.
The food is delicious.
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.
This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.
Amma is nothing special.
Yeah Shanghai is also great but not quite as good -- they use the same amount of salt but without sweetness to balance out.
believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.
Worth it for a special occasion, or any time!
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
I recommend to anyone who wants to dress up and impress the lady.
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
I had a late dinner at Lucky Stike, a great name for a joint if ever I saw one.
Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
Definitely a once a year treat that I look forward to around the holidays!
Service is fast and friendly.
from an English speaking staff.
Anyhow, we were able to sit as long as we wanted and chat, which was nice.
And they have these home made potato chips at the bar that are the most delicious things in the world!
A defitely must visit.
My husband and I enjoyed each of the 6 taste size portions and left completely full.
I went here with a friend on a whim, we went someplace else first and couldn't get a table.
We all ate pasta entre'es, which were great.
My friends and I showed up on a Sat.
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
great experience overall.
PERFECT FOR DATES!
The food was boring and expensive.
The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
Terrific menu full of unique rolls and special dishes.
The service is ok but could be better.
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
(I've ordered from the 2nd ave.
Nothing against a good sales call, but the tactics at Amma are just too obvious.
Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
Took my mom for Mother's Day, and the maitre d' was pretty rude.
My husband and I have been there a couple of times and each time we sat at the sushi bar (chef Yoshi) and ordered everything ala carte.
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
If the weather is nice, try to snag an outside table.
If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.
However, for what we spent, overall, it just was not up to par.
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
A friend from Seattle and I went on a Thursday night around 8:30.
When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
Never in my life did I think that I could be satisfied both in taste and in quantity for $3.00 in NYC.
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
The main course had an average portion, and was decent overall.
20 minutes for our reservation but it gave us time to have a few cocktails and enjoy our surroundings and each other.
Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
Waitstaff is great, very attentive.
I live in the neightborhood and am a regular.
The dinner menu is diverse and top-notch as well.
IT IS WHAT MODERN CUISINE IS ALL ABOUT.
In any event, even though its a bit on the pricey side, we still love this restaurant and will definitely go back.
I definitely will go back.
I don't like Indian food too much and this was delicious, however you want to factor that into the equation.
at taj, vegetarians can rejoice-all the dishes are manna from heaven.
Forget the rush and the wait and the noise (which isn't actually that bad), I mean please, who goes to a steakhouse to be coddled and romantic?
Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
I've never been disappointed.
I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
We live in New Jersey and whenever we go into New York City we buy bagels to eat hot and then to freeze (they told me that if I call in the order, they'd bring it out to the car so I wouldn't have to look for parking).
From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
Jimmy's is hands down the hottest night spot in the Bronx.
And I would have to agree with the masses in terms of service - delivery is their Achilles' heel.
My boyfriend and I have been to The Minnow four times now and we have consistently been impressed.
The $300 bill was a bit steep, but the experience was great.
I wouldn't mind going back some time, but not before trying others nearby.
Nice ambiance, nice little bar, good bartender, Francois, and good service.
I found this restaurant to be one that truly values its patrons.
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.
I would definitely go back -- if only for some of those exotic martinis on the blackboard.
For some reason the place was empty when we got in and remained so for the entire evening, I don't understand why but we had a blast and will definately go back the next time we are in the area.
Simple comfort food and what hot and lage portions.
But I just would like to say I read the reviews people left and thats why I checked it out.
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.
We didn't get drink refills and she didn't even offer us the option of dessert.
Beautiful experience.
The bagels are also reasonably priced for NYC.
If you can handle that, it's a great place for a business dinner, fun with friends or simply a table for 2.
Decor leaves something to be desired.
Jimmy is Dominican!
Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
Our waiter was fine, the place looks nice in that not-trying-too-hard way, but at those prices, a little more should be expected of your food.
Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
When my husband and go there, we spend $60.00 (have LOBSTER TAILS UMMMMM need I say more) I can't say any more, it a place you'll never forget If you never go, you'll miss A Meal of your life time
in an effort to increase turnover, the restaurant offers no desserts beyond the complimentary espresso cup filled with chocolate mousse.
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.
Oh yes, and if you are a fan of Indian oldies film stars, there are plenty of portraits of Indian actors and actresses in classic black white that adorn the walls, some of which, I would love to know where they obtained.
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.
The neighborhood was nice though so check out another restaurant instead.
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
If you are in search of the most authentic NYC deli experience look no further than the famous and historic Katz's Deli down on the Lower East Side.
Even upon delivery, their juicy pork buns are quite good . .
This is also where I was from.
Everything is for sale in here including the sculptured iron statue on the table.
Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
The entire place and the treatment we received felt as a conveyor belt.
Joe's Pizza used to have the best slice until this pizzeria opened up.
I in all reality felt as if I had just gotten off Air France and was in the 8th District in Paris.
I have never had anything like it!
Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.
And they provided a delicious dessert on the house!
They are still living in the dark ages and do not have an answering machine, so if you want to make a reservation you are limited.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
I am Indian, and I have tried many Indian places in NY.
Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!
On a recent Saturday night, I was with a group of 5 at the Bread Bar.
Food is great and inexpensive.
The price very reasonable.
Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!
It can be a little confusing as to where one goes to order, but once the food is ordered, you are in for a treat.
Take a good sense of humor,an American express card with no limit, walk out with a lollipop,gift bag in hand and enough marketing materials for alain to to take the show on the road
Ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me.
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food.
I recommend this spot to anyone who enjoys  fine cuisine at reasonable prices.
This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in NYC and I only wish it were more affordable so I could go more often!
The staff was very attentive, the ambience lovely, and the food superb.
I love when restaurants think using fancy expensive ingrediants makes the food fine cuisine, even with no idea how to use them.
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
THE FRANKENSTEIN SHOW WAS THE BEST.
The waiters are sweet, the food is tasty and the bill is never too large.
As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.
The service was superb, they treat you like family.
We all had the tasting menu and unlike some of the other reviews, I felt there was more than enough food.
It only took about five or so minutes to get an empty table, but standing up wasn't too bad.
The menu may be small, but everything on it is delicious.
Too bad Latin Quarters closed.
They had scrapped the bottom of the vessel in which they make the rice -RESULT - WE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OF BURNT RICE IN OUR SERVING BOWL.
It was divine melts in your mouth.
Stumbled upon this gem of a pizza place and I will be going back frequently.
I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.
- for dessert we split chocolate cake and vanilla gelato (with espresso), which were tasty, but I thought a bit overpriced.
When I visited my friend who lives in the Upper Eastside, she recommended that we go to this restaurant.
Warm, comfortable surroundings, nice appointments (witness the etched glass and brickwork separating the dining rooms).
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.
Kudos Haru
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
I plan on eating here more often.
I would definitely go back for a very special occasion, but not for regular fine dining.
The well mannered, pleasant staff that Tony has in his employ.
The flavors robust and subtle.
I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.
All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best.
I would never wait for a table to eat, it just is not THAT great.
We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
The counter service is bad.
I had a grat time at Jekyll and Hyde!
Service here was great, food was fantastic.
its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
This is such a lovely, peaceful place to eat outside.
and we were thouroughly disapointed.
This is the Jackel and Hideof the restaurants on the UES.
The sauce is delicious and the crust is perfect.
This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.
Since my first dinner I have had the chance to have brunch at Orsay 3x.
You will pay a lot for the decore, but the food is no better or worse than a lot of other Chinese and Asian fusion places in NY.
They have some great entrees here as well.
Our teenage kids love it, too.
The service is not consistently excellent -- just decent.
The food, served in small tasting portions (as an option) is very good with each dish being better than the next.
You guys are awesome!
They do cater to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!
I loved this place!!
I had the mango chicken and i can't go on to tell you how delicious that was and the presentation was beatiful.
I care more about the food and ambience.
Oh, but wait, we were out of drinks (which were also delightfully overpriced).
Avoid at all costs.
I would highly recommend this place to everyone for any occasion!
The service is fantastic.
I recommend that you try this hidden spot which will surely blowup very soon
The garlic mashed potatoes are hands down the best in the city!
Food and service was okay.
great for a romantic evening, or a fun evening with friends...
The lamb meat was under-cooked and EXTRMELY CHEWY.
The best pad thai i've ever had.
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
Great pizza and fantastic service.
We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
i would just ask for no oil next time.
While this is a pretty place in that overly cute French way, the food was insultingly horrible.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
I really didn't know what to expect for a restaurant that literally overlooks the main hall of Grand Central.
None of that yucky whipped stuff.
The wine list isn't great, and the desserts are shipped in from Bruno's down the street, which is not as good as it used to be.
I ordered a Lassi and asked 4 times for it but never got it.
Their coffee is quite good too!
I would not recommend this place to anyone.
great wine list (italian), good food, service was INITIALLY fine.
Despite the fact that the space is large, they've overcrowded the floor with tables.
i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
As far as the service goes, the waitresses were not particularly friendly, but they got the job done.
They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
Normally that would be improper, however they were all delicious and my host did not complain.
Taxan delicious!
Perhaps it was an off night, but it was suprisingly average for a 9.3 rating.
Unlike other places in NYC where the sandwiches you want only come as a triple-decker, here you can get what you want in a reasonably-sized portion (and price).
Southern Indian cuisine is still there, too.
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
For two people with tip was less than $25 bucks.
Killer Sushi!
Of course the reason its so packed is because the food is so delicious!
Staffs are not that friendly, but the taste covers all.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
And I've been to many NYC delis.
This place is always packed.
Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
Plus they made a perfect martini.
I am not sure if I would call the food here Indian as it is a fusion of what seems to be French with an Indian or exotic touch.
I've eaten thai many times, and am very familiar with the cuisine.
The waiter was attentive.
Their Margarita is best I've had since I've returned from Naples!
I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
The tastes makes your mouth water for more.
I came into the city to try out this restaurant because a friend had recommended it to my husband.
Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
All in all a wonderful experience, can't wait to come back.
The food was actually aweful.
after dining at B.O.G over twenty times now, its official !
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.
There is actually space to breathe and the decor sets the tone for an intimate dinner.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium.
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.
The sushi is average and the prices are anything but.
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions.
Owner must have coem on this website to give himself credit.
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down.
I would go back.
Definitely will be back!
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.
I'm not sure why these other reviewers are whining so much.
they live up to the thai way of living.
If you have a dumpling fetish i suggest you try some here!
Three page wine menu, one page entree and horedevous.
The food is consistently wonderful - I've been coming here for years, and the owner has always been accomodating and friendly.
The waiters and owners were nonchalant about this and promised to call the exterminator but weren't as dismayed or apologetic as I would have expected.
I live nearby and when they first opened, I ate there a lot.
And the food was fantastic.
This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
If you're looking for a place to sit down, have a drink and conversations with friends, go to sweet-n-tart and order yourself a hong-kong styled milk and tea with tapioca pearls (hot).
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
They're also friendlier here, especially the owner, Kenny.
While the room is not particularly comfortable, once you're seated you'll forget about everything except what's on your plate.
I've lived in NYC all my life and had never before seen so many waterbugs in one place (except in a really bad dream).
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
The ambiance is minimal the food is not phenomenal, but some dishes are quite good, such as the eggplant parmesan, veal in carozza chicken saltimbocca.
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
The bar has various selections and the mixed drink special is a catcher! 2 for 1's.
Slightly on the pricey side but worth it!
If it isn't for the food (A+++), it must be the service or the ambience.
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
We were exploring Grand Central and didn't want to eat in the food court.
Overall, not worth the money.
This place is not worth the prices.
We left after one drink.
Everything that happened was not even up to mediocre.
Our last time there a few weeks ago was early at 5pm and it was very crowded and noisy.
Pick a bagel has the best bagels in the city.
You are paying for the atmosphere, which is nice, but can be had in numerous places in Bay Ridge.
It's called Gnochi alla nona and is found under Chef Specials.
It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
Yes you have to wait to be seated and because its small there is no waiting area and the seat at the bar was all taken.
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
The fried dumplings are GREAT!
This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name.
The decor is very simple but comfortable.
I've been frequenting The Tasting Room since it first arrived in the East Village and I've never been disappointed.
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.
Heartland Brewery is a great way to start or finish your day.
The 'kamasutra' and 'bombay cosmopolitan' are excellent and will have you tipsy in no time.
This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.
The dim sum here is only so-so.
It was raining, and we figured why not?
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
Just straight up cheap, good food.
Another welcome addition to the neighborhood.
Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.
This time, I prefer not to go into detail.
Even with a relatively inexpensive botle of wine, if you can call $70.00 inexpensive, the cost is through the roof for better than average fare.
Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
My only problem is that you are literally sitting on top of the people next to you!
And affordable.
The staff makes you feel at home, the food is great and the atmosphere is WONDERFUL!
i actually feel like i should keep it a secret.
The food is alright - some stuff is good - some is not (like the steak dish which tends to be dry).
Not only would I not recommend Jimmy's restaurants to friends, I would strongly suggest they go anywhere but.
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.
Haru on Park S is simply disgusting.
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
I drop more dollar bills here than your uncle after a weekend at Scores.
The bagel was huge.
Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.
Get the tuna of gari.
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
It was a very nice surprise.
Edible but really a ripoff at those prices given whats in the area.
The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
I am French and I really felt like home!!!
I have been to Casimir over 5 times and I have always had a great time there.
The service was the only thing good about this restaurant.
It's usually packed for good reason, esp.
Service- friendly and attentive.
I love going there!
I cannot recommend OG more highly if I tried - check it out for yourself.
It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
Great food, great decor, great service.
And, atlhough tables opened up next to us and we ASKED for a slightly larger space, they left us awkardly seated.
The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.
I've dined at Alain Ducasse's restaurant in Monte Carlo for half the price for the same excellent dining experience.
Yeah, sometimes the service can be slow.
There was no ambiance.
Save your money and don't waste your calories, go to Margharita's on Washington Street instead, they have amazing food and the BEST service.
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.
But trust me it is so worth it.
It is not a place for tourists or someone who has never dined in Bay Ridge.
THe perfect spot.
The only weird thing was if we got a bottle, the waitress would have simply multiplied the glass price X4, which makes no sense whatsoever.
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.
DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
They never came back to refill our glasses again.
The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
Service was also very good.
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good meal.
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!
They're rude at times, and not very friendly.
I'm happy to have Nosh in the neighborhood and the food is very comforting.
Good atmosphere, combination of all the hottest music dress code is relatively strict except on Fridays.
They kindly brought us more to see if it was better, but it was not!
love the food.
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures.
All the desserts the group tried got favorable reviews.
There's something smooth about sipping sake upper east side style.
It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.
Best Reuben sandwich ever!
Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.
Wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well!
Going to Volare is like going to your favorite aunt's house for dinner, assuming that your aunt is a great Italian cook.
The sushi has been from average to below average, the wait service has always been sub-par the atmosphere goes from nice to really irritating (if you sit in the area beyond the kitchen, the acousitcs are horrid, everything echoes is extremely loud).
I loved it and would go again.
Frites were delicious if a bit on the thick side.
SO SO SO SO SO good!
Alone for 100 bucks, it is really overprice.
Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.
Very good value
Here you get the zen feel without feeling rigid.
I would recommend putting your name down and then getting a drink at a local bar first though because of the wait time.
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
I keep my fingers crossed the whole subway ride hoping that there will be a table I can sit at by myself and not have to share with the rice congee soup people.
Overall, the best bagel in town.
Everything a NY pizza joint should be.
It was huge, delicious, fresh, and will be the reason we return.
We go often.
Light, refreshing summer rolls (not fried) remind me of Vietnamese places in Paris.
The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
moral stay away.
but the service was a bit slow.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
When I saw that their website had a link to da Ciro in Napoli, I knew there was going to be good pizza!
No one asked what was wrong as we left with nothing touched on our plates.
Indoor was very cozy and cute.
We had a 3 hour brunch- they definitely do not rush you- and they kept the unlimited mimosas flowing the whole time.
And their prices are very high - they actually think that they can get away with charging such prices for such terrible food and service!
They're terrific!!
The service was excellent, the food was excellent, but the entire experience was very cool.
The service is good and the resturant is clean.
Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.
Just stick with the small dishes!
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.
I've rarely had a problem with slow staff in the 10 years I've been going.
Food is excellent.
This place is a literal hole-in-the-wall that is buried within Doyers, right off of Pell St (barber's alley) in Chinatown.
They outshine HH.
Although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great.
Excellent lunch buffet for only $6.95.
We were sorry to check them off our list as we had enjoyed and recommended the place in the past.
If you're not familiar with the cuisine, you may encounter problems ordering here and be sure to bring plenty of cash with you as they don't accept credit cards.
both are very reasonably priced (around $8 for dinner and $5 for lunch), and are delicious and filling.
Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
Ambience is so cute and quaint, good for business although we were there on vacation.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
Just wish they'd expand.
My boyfriend ate tuna and it was cooked perfectly!
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
Good food at the restaurant (a bit expensive, but great if you want to impress your date).
I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.
You can't say its cheap because food is cheaper in Chinatown.
I have eaten there 3-4 times and the food was always good.
keep up the good work.
I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.
great eats, good times.
Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
Grilled whole fish wonderful, great spicing.
For years, I thought Tuscan cuisine was the best, but Salvatore converted me to the hearty Neapolitan fare on my first visit.
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
The service was great as well.
Try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll.
Another plus is most of the entrees are approx.
I will go back to Suan soon!
Loved it!
The food was delicious, the atmosphere was relaxed, and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second!
We were pleasantly surprised.
From the moment we walked in they were more than accomodating even though the place was packed.
It is LOUD, HOT and DARK.
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
The food is definitely good, but I left a bit disappointed.
I am a 100 lb girl, had a glass of wine and a glass of beer prior to the dinner, and I was still HUNGRY after my visit to this place!
The drinks are a saving grace, but service staff, please, get over yourselves.
There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
Will give it another chance before I write it off.
The all-Italian staff is warm and engaging from the start.
Village is one of those places that scores on all fronts.
The prices are exceptionally reasonable for food of this caliber.
If you go here - your focus should be the Tamarind Margaritas.
It is the best hidden spot there and I rave about it to everyone.
The filet mignon dish was superb!
I had been a regular due to the consistently good food and ease of getting a table.
Can't wait wait for my next visit.
This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
The food is good, I can't lie.
great food, lt's of it, more then one person can eat!
I didn't expect to like Nosh as much as I did, but the pastrami on challah sandwich I had was otherworldly, the soups are like Mom's, and the knishes give Yonah Schimmel's a run for its money.
The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
This place is worth going even if only for their beer.
I really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi (on saffron risotto-yum!).
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
The sandwhiches are out-of-this world!
If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for Thia food.
Decor is charming.
The food was very well prepared.
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though.
Stay away from this place.
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.
Complimentary stuff kept coming, and when the waiter saw me opening a gift, I received my dessert on a plate that had Happy Birthday written on it, with a candlevery nice touch, and attentive staff.
The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.
If you go for the pre-theatre menu, it's an even greater deal.
The one up front will smile and say What can I get for you, brother?
Brava La Pizza Fresca!
If you are someone who appreciates simplicity, elegance, and wonderfully presented and tasting seafood and vegetables regardless of portion size, Kai is your place.
The prices cannot be beat for the quality, quantity, freshness and taste.
Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.
If just to drop in, quickly stuff yourself and jet out -- to keep their turn-over.
Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had!
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES.
I have been about 4 times and have always had a great meal.
I go back in line like three times on average until I can't walk anymore.
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.
Horrible food and Horrible service.
The wine and cheese plate are plentiful and can't wait to try the fondue or table grilling.
Bleecker St Pizza is the best!
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HEARTLAND BREWERY.
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared.
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
Even if the food wasn't this good, the garden is a great place to sit outside and relax.
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
The chicken and steak were seasoned and cooked to perfection, and the lamb sandwhich is great for heartier appetites.
Faan is sooo good.
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which dim sum dish it was.
No you're going to go back because the food was good.
The food was great and the service was even better.
While this can hardly be called a restaurant, it is possibly the best deal in Manhatten: $4 for a plate heaped with rice and 2-3 entrees.
Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
I will not be coming here at 3am again.
Very good wine choices.
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights.
We were seated and ignored by waitstaff.
If you are in a big group, this place is perfect because it recomends sharing - they have lazy susans on most tables - even families can feel comfortable here.
They showed up 15 minutes after the tuna melt.
Tasty steak, pork loin, the works.
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.
I went to Ruby Foos for my birthday and enjoyed our experience there.
I'd highly recommend it for a special occasion -- it provides and intimate setting and nice service.
The burger was great, also.
they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
The pizza was great.
And everytime I go there's a bunch of drunk idiots making a scene out front.
I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
When we notified him that he didn't mention the specials, he didn't apologize but let us know that we made a very good decision regardless.
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.
Kenny the owner is always there and he treats my family like we are part of his family.
They need a kick out of it but until then the sushi is pretty good and the place is consistent.
I've had to wait only a few times during lunch but this place is definitely worth the wait.
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.
Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!
For appetizers, I recommend the shrimp fritters and dumplings.
And cheap!
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food.
The restaurant is dark and not very attractive and then you have spot lights shining on you putting you in the worst light possible, reaching for sunglasses.
Try the Times Square cocktail -- ginger lemonade with vodka (also available without vodka.)
Nice find.
Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!
Great wine, great food.
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
The food and staff always surprise me with the new heights they are taken to.
Amazing!
Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca).
I've always been seated propmtly.
We try frequenting new restaurants all over the city, but any time that we  visit a restaurant other than Roth's we are always disappointed.
honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.
There is nothing more pleasant than that.
I would recommend this place to anyone and would without a doubt come again.
However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
What makes this restaurant special are the authentic sichuan cooking and being the only one in NYC that offers authentic chongqing hotpot.
Mizu is the Japenese find in Grammercy.
For sure i will keep coming back because i feel really this restaurant deserves.
Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.
Sake collection was excellent (Try Nanbu Bijin), but pricy.
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.
One of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.
I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
Ask for Usha, the nicest bartender in manhattan.
The service is outstanding and my crab-cake eggs benedict could not have been better.
The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.
This is a true gem of the village.
Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
However, I think Jeckll and Hydes t is one of those places that is fun to do once.
They treat me like family, morning and night.
A wonderful place!
Please take my advice, go and try this place.
Service was on par but not wonderful.
for my birthday and we had an excellent time.
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.
I went to Amma after a friend recommended it.
I'm just reading some of these reviews and its nonsense that people are reviewing some places because it was too loud.
Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
Maybe tomorrow ;-)
We also ordered two hot dogs thinking they would be pretty good since there is a whole section on the menu devoted to them.
please don't fool us.
I've had the chicken with garlic sauce, chicken with black bean sauce, and hunan chicken.
Because of the delicate thin crust, take-out pies get soggy in their boxes.
I suspect this restaurant is what Rao's would be if it hadn't turned exclusive.
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.
strike up a conversation with the attorney next to you, or with the local union worker on the other side.
We were then shooed inside.
We got in line and were served while in line a bannan fritter.
It might have been a little too spicy for my friend, which you can couteract with eat more rice and keeping water on hand.
This place is always very crowded and popular.
Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
really depends on your luck!
Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's dinner.
I don't know about you guys, but when I go somewhere to eat I go for the food not for the atmosphere.
They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
Very different than regular dimsum places.
I have lived in NY for many years and have dined at many restaraunts.
When you enter, you feel like you have entered your mom's kitchen.
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
I've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.
She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too.
And when I visit her I make it a point to eat at 'Ino at least once daily if not once for the whole trip.
I wasn't there for the Half-Price Saturday Night Special, but Tuesday Night.
In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.
There was a small group of us looking somewhere to eat kinda late on a weeknight and we ended up at Pastis.
for Meetball Night.
If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.
They are opening two more places as i saw a flyer there one in Yonkers which is a restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey.
Want to impress?
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.
We've lived in the area for more than 8 years.
Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.
I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a lunch- I dont mind.
My family and I ate here last night for our annual Christmas dinner with the family members who would rather spend the holidays with friends out-of-town.
I grew up on these bagels.
We were told that they were booked solid and no other table was available.
The restaraurant is very small so reservations are a must.
Visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews.
A one women show!
You can't go wrong here.
At first i was rolling my ideas of yet another French place on the UES.
To my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.
In China the phrase for a good restaurant is hot and loud.
After dealing with subpar pizza all over the Kensington neighborhood - I've found little toninos.
I thought this place was totally overrated.
then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
You won't find that anywhere in Manhattan.
How do you rate home?
I went here in the afternoon with a friend.
Our first greeting when we entered was The last call is at 10:15.
Interior was so so.
I'm partial to the Gnocchi.
I guess the way my friends and I described it was The French Colonies.
they were able to squeeze me in at 6 after i called the night before my anniversary for a friday night reservation and told me they'd treat us well for the occasion.
Boy was I wrong!
I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.
Note that they do not serve beer, you must bring your own.
We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
When we walked in it seemed like it was there for 200 years.
Ahhh...
Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
it helps if you know what to order.
The service was typical short-order, dinner type.
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi.
I can't believe people complain about no cheese sticks?
But that is highly forgivable.
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.
When we arrived at 6:00 PM, the restaurant was practically empty.
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.
I am going to the mid town location next.
