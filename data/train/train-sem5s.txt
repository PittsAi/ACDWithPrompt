If you live in new york city, you'll find better food at small restaurants outside of time square and spend half the amount.
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.
I must say the view of NYC is so beautiful!
But the thing that my wife and I hated was it was so loud and it felt like 'bar' or 'pub'.
I loved it and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.
It was wonderful.
Our agreed favorite is the orrechiete with sausage and chicken (usually the waiters are kind enough to split the dish in half so you get to sample both meats).
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
The place was quiet and delightful.
We generally like good restaurants and eat out often but Kai was way to expensive for what we got.
Just an odd group.
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
Had we been stalling I could understand where they were coming from, but we had been there less than an hour and they hadn't even brought us a check yet!
When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
and never strayed.
Not cheap, but not that expensive either.
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
It's a really great deal, considering we got full off of four dollars.
Service was very good and warm.
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
